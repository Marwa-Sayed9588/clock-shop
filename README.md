## Introduction
#### [Clock Shop](https://drawcall.github.io/clock-shop/) is a website that collects beautiful clock codes. You can visit it [here](https://drawcall.github.io/clock-shop/).

It contains some creatively designed clock animations, beautifully shaped classic clocks, and some technologically stimulating electronic clocks. All the code comes from the [codepen](https://codepen.io/) website.

## Reason
On a weekend, I saw a great clock code on the [codepen](https://codepen.io/) website. So I had an idea, why not collect these beautiful clocks and share them with everyone? Good things always have to be enjoyed by more people! So I made this website!

All the code comes from the [codepen](https://codepen.io/) site. They are really great. I want to pay tribute to the original author!
